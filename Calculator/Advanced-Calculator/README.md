# AVR-Advanced-Calculator
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a simple calculator based on the Atmega32 microcontroller, an LCD display, and a keypad. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as decimal point and sign changes.

# Features
- 16x2 character LCD display for showing input and results
- 4x4 keypad for entering numbers and operators
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Decimal point and sign changes
- Clear function
- Error handling for division by zero and syntax error

# Hardware Requirements
- Atmega32 microcontroller
- 16x2 character LCD display (e.g., HD44780-based)
- 4x4 keypad (e.g., membrane or mechanical)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard or PCB for prototyping
- 5V power supply (e.g., USB or battery)

# Software Requirements
- AVR-GCC compiler
- AVRDUDE programmer
- GNU Make build system
- AVR-LibC standard library
- AVR-GCC C standard library
- AVR-GCC math library
- AVR-GCC IO library

#Usage
To use the calculator, simply connect the Atmega32 microcontroller to the LCD display and keypad using jumper wires and a breadboard or PCB. Then, compile the source code using AVR-GCC and AVRDUDE, and upload the resulting binary file to the microcontroller using a programmer. Finally, power on the calculator and start calculating!
